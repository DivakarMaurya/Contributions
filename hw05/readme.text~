   examples of how mmap() allows you to access registers directly.
Created  a C program [gpioThru.c] that reads from at least two switches and controls two LEDs (the built-in LEDs are fine). The GPIO pins used for the switches are from two different GPIO ports. 
I used two separate mmap() calls and Called this mmap2.c.
Modified gpioThru.c to read from a switch and controlled an LED.
